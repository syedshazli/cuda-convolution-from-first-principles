# Convolution in CUDA From First Principles
Implementing a convolution layer in CUDA, based on Pytorch nn.conv2D. 

## Repository Structure
Code for convolution in cuda is under src, in which you'll find CPU implementations of convolution and a GPU implementation. Performance and correctness testing is under the 'Tests' directory, while scripts for running the tests is under the 'Scripts' directory.
